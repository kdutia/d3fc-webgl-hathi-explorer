# Science Museum Group visualisation

An early version of a visualisation of knowledge graph embeddings created for the Heritage Connector project. This now lives at [heritage-connector-demos](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/heritage-connector-demos).

This implementation uses D3FC's WebGL Series.
